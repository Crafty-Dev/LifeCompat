# LifeCompat

LifeCompat is a Compatibility Mod designed to simplify essential Modding Processes like events, bucket compatibility, and Energy. This Library currently provides a pretty lightweight but strong Event API and a way to add Custom Buckets without the need of dealing directly with Minecraft's Code.
